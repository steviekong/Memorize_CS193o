# Memorize!
A simple game built in swiftUI so I can learn swiftUI. This app should work on ios devices. 

I am using free resouces from Stanford to learn SwiftUI! Check out [https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu/](https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu/) for the course.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the project in xcode
3. Run the project using xcode

Note: There are no dependiencies since this is meant to be a simple project

## Contibution

I don't expect anyone to contibute to this since I'm just doing it to learn SwiftUI  but if you wanted to please submit a pull request highlighting the change.
